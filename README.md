# VC-Trends-DA-Project
In this project MySQL was used for data exploration and analysis after doing minimal data editing and cleaning with Excel. It is my first collaboration project with another Github member as most of my other analysis has been completed solely. The goal was to find key trends and answer questions which have been prevalent in the VC industry.
